This repository contains some of my machine learning-related experiments:

- Polynomial finder (genetic programming): Genetic programming is a technique that involves applying processes similar to natural selection to a population of random programs until you get a program that solves your problem efficiently. Here, this approach is used to find the polynomial function that approximates best a set of pairs of values.
- Jerry the bot (deep learning) : a simple chat bot that than recognize the user’s intent. It works using a neural network.
- Tic-tac-toe (reinforcment learning): most AI models are first trained with a set of training data. This one works differently: it is continuously trained and gets better without any preliminary training step.
- Voice assistant: a desktop voice assistant that can perform operations such as copying/cutting/deleting files, opening or closing programs, do searches on Wikipedia, etc... It uses a speech recognition module.
