Jerry is a bot based on intent recognition using a neural network. Jerry can currently recognize 26 intents. Don't expect him to be your next personal assistant, though. Jerry is mostly an experiment, and as such he cannot do anything besides telling you jokes and doing a couple of other things.

Here are some of the modules and frameworks used:
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- NLTK

The training data are based on the dataset provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanlarson/outofscope-intent-classification-dataset
